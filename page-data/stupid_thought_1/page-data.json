Life just went by time after time and the worst I could do was to sit down and to lament about the thing that I could do better. Things changed a lot after that. I felt the sense of losing a grip of something I thought I have it controlled. I started losing sleep, hope, and faith. Feeling insecure and questioning everything were things I consume 3 am in the morning which is 1 hour before a proper sleep. There is one question that I always asked and I will never forget, <!--more--> ”What is the point of all of this?”. Don’t get me wrong, I wasn’t thinking of money or life, in fact, I question the very basic idea of that. Why do I start this, if at the end of the day, we all live in fear of something we never know? Because, at the end of the day, nothing matter, no matter how much you made, you simply will never be prepared at all, it’s always just a never ending gamble and you just have much more stuff to bet, and there will never be a winner. Because goal does not exist, it’s just a jackpot on a pathway to death and none knows whether or not it will come. Hope/faith are the only thing we could reason to face that which just provide more information that nobody is really in control of everything. I swear that was what I had in my mind at least 2 years ago, at least until I change the way I view the world. Currently, I think I might have everything under control. Although I am not blessed with a significant other or any particular amount of fortune, I could still take a deep breath at the end of the day and be grateful for whatever shit that happen throughout the day. In fact, I even have what I will later define as hope and I am glad I am finally okay with that.</p>\n<p>It was very random for me, but I think this would the best way for me to see it. Before everything else, I started with understanding one very important thing that I think we should agree as well. ”Everything is dying and we can’t change that”. We are all dying at different rate, and different funnel. It was pretty easy isn’t it? But this is the reason I think everything doesn’t matter until you bend the fact. You might argue, I know, since you said that nothing is certain, there is no real proof that we are dying. But that was not the point. But I borrowed that concept to help myself understand the bigger picture. Bear with me, this is going to be stupid but you are going to like it. Assume that you will never die. You might think ”But dude, the concept is absurd, billions of cells died and entropy is a bi***, how could you assume so”. I know, but the very concept that you define is that your body is dying and we all are agree on that. Remember, I said you not your body. Now how does this thing work? We need to step up our assumption game, remember the future is uncertain so you are free to assume (or the more familiar word is dream). Let’s assume that you are a scientist. You developed a technology that allow you to preserve your mind, a bit of cogito ergo sum reference here. Every time you are about to hit the critical point of about to die, you programmed your device to preserve your mind, and inject it to other timeline or reality. Now, what do you have? You just escaped death and you live your new life with the same preserved mind. Well, at least that was the first step.</p>\n<p>Now that we have assumed something so absurd that you start questioning life choices that lead you to this paragraph, we could move on to the next step. ”Dude, why can’t we just assume that I achieve everything in my next life you said so don’t you?”. I said so? Damn right I do, and you are damn right I am going to assume that as well, and that’s just possible since you live forever you have 100 percent to achieve everything, correct? Now let’s gather information. Every time you move your mind, you understand two things. You always learn and things always changes. Both of these are equally important to decide your future life choices and will decide whether or not you are just okay with what you want to do. ”What the f*** dude, you don’t even mention why.” I know, here’s why.</p>\n<p>Okay, let’s say I am a big fan of football. In one of my life, I would assume myself to win everything I could win in football and do stupid stuff such as scoring 1000 goal in a month etc. Of course, I will take everything for myself. One day, I died and I will live my next life. Now what do I need to do? I need to invent a new stuff to like to finally able to crush it. I will do this again and again and again. What happen afterwards is that you start understanding one particular thing, things will never end, and that you will never get enough of what you have. It’s just part of the curse we have. Now big question? Am I a happy boy? Not really, I haven’t done that one thing on my list that will never leave the list. ”But dude, that’s debatable, what if I am happy after the 1000 goals per month and decide that I don’t want to die now”, yeah nerd how can you be sure that you are happy with that? And that you won’t crave for 2000 goals per month, or another stuff? You might find it easy but at one point, you might consider putting a stop on it, and decide to die peacefully. If you don’t then don’t read the next paragraph, you should continue to the paragraph after that.</p>\n<p>Now what did you learn? Even after you are given eternal life, by default, you just want to die. ”Okay dude, now where is the part of this horrible sci fi wanna be story that change the way to see stuff?”. If you find yourself here, you are either want to die, or you are not reading the instruction properly. One thing that is very clear from the story above is that I put the focus on myself. Whether or not I could get enough of what is given is the question that need to be addressed at the end of the day. What do you think would happen if you finally throw away the list, and decide to live the best of it and by the best of it, I mean enjoy the rest of your life with the people inside it. In the end of that life, there is one question do you still consider switching to other body? Well at this moment, I answered I am okay with everything, I am going to throw a coin and decide. I don’t give an F on whatever the F could happen, I am just happy that I exist. You could skip the paragraph below if you are reading this one.</p>\n<p>So what if I find it cool and I will always do it again and again. Now that’s not wrong as well. You might not realize it but there is something that you literally do which is very inception thingy. You love your life and you love the feeling on achieving something no matter how far it is, because that’s what your mind loves to do and you will always crave for something. But let’s assume one day, your machine dies and you will never live your next life. Short answer is since I live forever, I could have assumed that I could fix it and go on. Now what if it really died out and you don’t have enough to fix it. Well some will give up and cry for the rest of their life reminiscing everything that is done. I came up with a better idea, what if I taught the people in that life on whatever knowledge I have, since I have nearly infinite level of knowledge better than them, since I live forever. I know one thing that is so certain, that they will learn and so will their child and so will their grandchildren and so on. And what I would do is that I know that there is a 100% chance that they will end up being better and smarter than me because I stop learning at this point, and with that solving the crisis I am having or even better end up reviving me. I might die at that time, but one thing that is clear here is that even in death I still have something I call hope. And one thing that you will always understand, that you don’t regret it, you know one day that they will be better than you, some might find it happy but even if you don’t have any feeling on other people achievement, it is always feels good when you know you are going to live again because you know you just want to continue your infinite journey of being the best of you.</p>\n<p>Now if you skip one paragraph, you understand that this article is not targeted to same individual. That all of us could be easily generalized into first or second paragraph. Now you might ask what is the point of this and what part change your point of view. Well, I finally understand that I am the one that choose to live my life as the dude in the second paragraph. The concept of the story is to erase the limit that has been a ghost for us to understand our true purpose, time. Now that I know I will end up doing the infinite journey. I can’t rely on myself, I will love to have hope and dreams, and I will do whatever needed to help myself and the people I live with right now. And I know, My body might decay but I will never die because the idea I represent will still live on and even in death I will still have hope on myself. Now what’s my next move? In that simulation you pick an interest, I am going to do the same thing, I am picking a topic to be best at. Now what will that topic be? The answer is whatever you crave right now, and now the next move will be just like the simulation. Be the very best of it, live it, share it with other, help others and die.</p>\n<p>Now I don’t know about the other or what you should do, but you should know what you should do. Simply putting it, live this moment.</p>\n<p>Okay now which one is better? The answer is none. Remember when I say life is just a gamble and dude with more money got more to bet? Exactly the point, no one ever know the future and it’s never about the future. It’s about what your truly mind say want to do no matter what the future is cause the worst that could happen is death and you already know how to face it and both ways are equally proved to be good in their own way.</p>\n<p><strong>Now,  what are you going to do?</strong></p>","frontmatter":{"layout":"post","title":"Stupid Thought 1 📝","path":"/stupid_thought_1/","category":"Stupid Thought","tags":["Life"],"date":"2019/05/29"}}},"pageContext":{}}}
